    The multi-conclusion sequent calculus, with multiplicative versions of the branching rules (gasp!).
    This encoding is a testbed, so I have made it use the extreme form of axiom, it doesn't copy 
    Dyckhoff-style in the →⊢ and ∀⊢ rules.  Because of multiplicativity (and sometimes because of
    un-Dyckhoffry), you have to use contraction sometimes.
